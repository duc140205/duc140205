Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a developer-in-training with a passion for clean code and captivating performances.

ðŸ’» CRAFTING THE FUTURE: As a Software Engineering student at FPT University, I'm building my skills one line of code at a time, turning complex problems into elegant software solutions.

ðŸš€ BUILDING & LEARNING: I'm currently focused on diving deep into new technologies and working on projects that challenge and inspire me. My goal is to create applications that are both powerful and user-friendly.

ðŸ’œ MY BIAS & INSPIRATION: When I'm not coding, I'm tuned into the world of K-Pop, inspired by the incredible talent of Winter (aespa). She's a reminder that dedication and artistry create truly iconic results!
